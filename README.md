# Welcome to my todo app

## Deployment
The website is deployed in an Azure web app, and a production version of the app can be viewed at: https://mk-todo.azurewebsites.net/.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to explore features of the React.js framework, and deploy a project on Azure. I learned a lot about organization of a typical react app, and how to streamline Azure deployment.

## Vision
The idea of the website is that users can add and remove todos. The website should also look nice and work well on desktop and mobile.

## Next Steps
I want to implement SSO so that todo items can be remembered across devices. This will allow me to gather experience with authentication and apis. I also want to store the todos of unauthenticated users in browser cookies so they can be remembered between sessions. Finally, I plan to port this website to a mobile app with React Native.
